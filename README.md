# Predicting-COVID-19-condition-and-hospitalization-levels-using-blood-analysis-and-test-results
This projects aims to predict whether the patient has been infected by COVID-19, as well as s/he is hospitalized in one of the three units: regular ward, semi intensive or intensive care unit meaning that there are four target variables to predict. The dataset is small, has high number of missing values and as expected, highly imbalanced. It contains wide range of blood test variables which will form the main features of the model and other test variables with small variation which makes them challenging to use in the model.
